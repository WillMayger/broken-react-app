# Starters-test

Please read this entire document before beginning the test.

This is your interview test.
Here is a broken application built using React and ES6 among other things.

The main priority will be to get it working like in the photos below, however, the code needs to be valid ES6 code, in good form.


### Here is how the application should look & function when complete.
### Step 1

## Guide.
  - Fix any syntax errors and ect so you can see your first page. Which should look similar to step one.
  - Fix the styles on the welcome page by putting the text box in the center of the page. Use as little code as you can and try to use the code that already exists.
  - Try to navigate to "/app", change as little code as you can to do this.
  - Get the styles working on /app
  - Get the app functioning so it will now take your name and display it,
  - Your favourite number via a count that will not go below 0 but has no upper limit.
  - Your date of birth that will output the day you were born on.
 
## Tips.
- There is one file that you should not touch, this is the "state.json" file as this is mocking data you would receive from an api.
- Favour the API call for state with json over the javascript file with the initial state (you will find a api call already in the code).
- Refactor everywhere possible, even the files that might already be working.
- Prefer controlled components.
- Make sure any array or object, where needed, is immutable.
- Try to use best practices for React.
- Make sure you use the correct proptypes.

## Extra.
- If you get time, try adding in a button. This button will trigger the app to re-render to say that the form has been submitted. This button should only be clickable after all inputs have been entered.
- Improve the styles of the page as long as the functionality is clear.
- Should work at all screen sizes.
- Add in form validation.
